# Hangman game created with React and TypeScript

## This is a small project where I created a Hangman game using React and TypeScript. The user can select between 2 difficulty modes (different number of guesses). The user can enter the word using the onscreen keyboard or their physical keyboard, and the corresponding event will happen if the letter is correct or not. Pressing enter will refresh the page, allowing the user to restart the game with a new word.

* Vite was used to create the project files at the start.  
* React with TypeScript was used to code the game.  
* Using React Hooks API was used to create the interface.  
* Created a custom hook, to simplfy the code in the component and allow the logic to be reused.  
* TypeScript allowed to ensure only a certain type can be passed, ensuring the correct data is sent within the props.  
* The design of the game was created in the mind of old school blackboard.  
* Keyboard events are used to allow the user to use their keyboard for inputting the numbers.  
* Add Confetti when the user guesses the word correctly, to make it feel more exticiting.
